    "We may be tempted to think that our work isn’t valuable enough to be hacked so we don’t need to take cybersecurity seriously.  However, what we must understand is that HPC resources as well as many services you will use, are shared resources. They are used by many researchers studying a wide range of problems and are only as secure at the weakest link in the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any issues arising from the actions of one individual can therefore impact many of your colleagues and result in resources being taken offline whilst issues are investigated and remedied. Furthermore HPC systems are expensive resources typically run by small or modest sized teams so impacts, whilst hopefully rare, can be costly in time and personpower. This is before we consider the potential loss of data or breaches of sensitive data.\n"

    "Generally HPC systems have scratch storage filesystems.  While these enable the fast and high bandwidth access required by High Performance computing it means the data is typically not backed up.  As a result you should ensure that your data is copied elsewhere as soon as possible and removed from the scratch filesystem.  This will also help to ensure that the HPC system operates optimally, as full file systems have slower performance and put jobs at risk of failing if no space is available to write output.  Futhermore if there is a security concern on a system, if you do not have data on it, you are not at risk of losing it or it being compromised.\n",
