    "As HPC services are remote machines, interaction is done over an encrypted communication channel called Secure Shell version 2 (SSH-2). This allows command-line access to remote systems such as the login nodes of HPC services.  From these you can run commands, submit jobs or use a command-line text editor to edit files. `ssh` can also be used to run graphical programs such as GUI text editors and debuggers when used in conjunction with an X server."
