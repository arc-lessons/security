    "Some systems will also/instead require you to set up an SSH key pair to access the services.  The SSH key pair consists of a private part and a public part.  The public key can be put on remote machines to allow you to log-in without the use of a password.  You keep the private part of the key secure on your local machine protected with a passphrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public key encryption uses fancy maths to enable secure communication over an open channel.  There are a number of methods the most common being [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) which uses prime numbers.  If you are going to use this you should use a key size of at least 2048 and preferably 4096.  Public keys can be broken with brute force computation and the longer the key the more secure it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative encryption method and the one we recommend you to use are based on [EdDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA) (Ed25519).  For our purposes the key pair works in the same way.  Your public key can go on the remote resource or service and the private key is kept protected on your local machine.  You can generate a key pair with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "* `-t ed25519` specifies the encryption method used\n",
    "* `-f filename` specifies the name of the ssh key, by default these are stored in the directory `~/.ssh`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a SSH key pair you will be prompted to provide a `passphrase`.  This is effectively password for your private key and like a password should be kept secret.  Now when you try to use the key, you should be asked for your key pair **passphase** (which you entered when you created the key pair) rather than your remote machine **password**."
