    "So far we have just replaced the need to enter a password to access a remote host with the need to enter a key pair passphrase.  Because of this is may be tempting to leave the passphrase empty when creating your key so that we do not have to enter it every time we access a service which may be many times a day.  This is poor security practise and is  likely to be in breach of the acceptable use policies covering the services you are accessing.\n",

    "It is also a completely unnecessary risk as you can enable an agent on your local system so that you only have to enter the passphrase *once* and after that you will be able to access the remote system without entering the passphrase.  Here we will demostrate how to use `ssh-agent` but:\n",
